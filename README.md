## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal disclaimer

**This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing only.**

- Use only on networks you own or where you have explicit written permission to test.  
- Unauthorized use may violate local, state, and federal laws.  
- The authors are not responsible for misuse or damages.  
- Always comply with local laws and rules.

---

## üéØ Features

- **Real packet transmission** ‚Äî uses the native RTL8720dn APIs for beacon frame injection.  
- **Multi-channel support** ‚Äî automatic channel hopping across configured channels.  
- **Built-in SSIDs** ‚Äî includes 10 predefined SSID names.  
- **MAC randomization** ‚Äî generates a unique MAC address for each frame.  
- **Performance monitoring** ‚Äî real-time statistics output via serial.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **BW16 board** with the RTL8720dn chipset  
- **USB cable** for programming and power  
- **Arduino IDE** with the Ameba Arduino package installed

---

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sprensis/Beacon-Spam-BW16.git
   cd Beacon-Spam-BW16
````


2. **Configure the Arduino IDE**

   * Install the **Ameba Arduino** package.
   * Select **Ameba RTL8720dn (BW16)** as the board.
   * Set the correct COM/serial port.

3. **Upload the firmware**

   * Open `src/Beacon_spam_main/Beacon_spam_main.ino` in Arduino IDE.
   * Click **Upload** to flash the board.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit configuration values in `Beacon_spam_main.ino` before compiling:

```cpp
const uint8_t channels[] = {1, 6, 11};  // Wi-Fi channels to use
const bool wpa2 = false;                // Enable/disable WPA2 flag in SSIDs (simulated)
const bool appendSpaces = true;         // Append spaces to SSID names (optional)
const int maxSSIDs = 100;               // Maximum number of SSIDs to generate/use
```

Additional options and built-in SSID lists can be found in the sketch files under `src/`.

---

## üîß Usage

1. Power the BW16 board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**.
3. The device will automatically start transmitting beacon frames according to the configured settings.
4. Monitor packet counts, channel statistics, and other runtime information via serial output.

### Example serial output

## üîç Troubleshooting

* Ensure the Ameba Arduino package is installed and the BW16 (RTL8720dn) board is selected.
* Verify the correct COM port is selected and the board is powered.
* If uploads fail, try pressing the board‚Äôs boot/reset buttons as required by your hardware revision.
* Serial output may require opening the Serial Monitor at **115200** baud.
* For low packet rates or unexpected behavior, check other running tasks on the board and reduce SSID count or transmission interval.

---

## Performance

* **Typical packet rate**: 40‚Äì50 packets per second
* **Channel switch time**: ~10 ms
* **RAM usage**: ~15 KB
* **Flash usage**: ~25 KB
* **Power consumption**: ~150 mA @ 3.3 V

---

## Safety & Responsible Use

* Test only on networks you own or where you have explicit authorization.
* Be mindful of local regulations and legal constraints around RF transmission and network testing.
* Keep experiments in an isolated lab environment to avoid affecting production networks.
* Document testing activities and obtain written permission where required.
